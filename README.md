# AllSkyCamera
Pi5 based AllSkyCamera.

Project started September 2025.

After doing some research in August, I thought I would like to have a try at building my own all-sky camera. In the past, a lot of the personal projects I have worked on have mainly been a download and run affiar. With this however, I was more keen to have this be my first full-stack project.

# Project Outline

As a basic MoSCoW/Need, Nice, Nuts breakdown are as follows.

1. Needs to generate time lapses from midnight-midnight everyday automatically. Also needs to be minimally disruptive.

2. Nice if it was able to automatically send the timelapses to an email list of contacts.

3. Nuts but could incorporate some parameters for people who get time lapses eg if they only wanted daytime or night time. Possible to also include something like list of space objects visible.

As much as possible, we want to avoid project creep and keep building of the minimum viable product.

# Personal Influence

In this project, I want to organise, write and output the highest quality work I can deliver.
